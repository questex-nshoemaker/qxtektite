# Quick Start

## Requirements
In order to get the system up you'll need to have installed:

* node.js
* bower
* grunt

You can download node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once node.js is installed, run the following command in your terminal to install Bower and Grunt globally on your system:

    $ npm install -g bower grunt-cli

## Installing

* Fork project off Github
* In your terminal, cd to [DRUPAL THEME]
* Run these commands

    - Install necessary node modules once
      $ npm install
    - Watch and serve sass/js files and process them
      $ grunt serve

Each time you need to edit files, run 'grunt serve' so they get processed.

To cancel the grunt serve, click 'ctrl + C'.
